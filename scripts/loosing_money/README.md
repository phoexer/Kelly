# Loosing Money

Someone on Quora asked the question:
> Press a button and there is a 99% chance of doubling your money
> and a 1% chance of losing it all. 
> How many times will you press the button?
    
I was bored so I wrote this to simulate the situation, 
then started mucking around with it. 

I was going to extend it to do some maths but I stopped being bored.
