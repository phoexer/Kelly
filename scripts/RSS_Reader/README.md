# RSS Reader

Long long ago in a galaxy far far away, I started a Machine Learning Project(Cathy) and needed something that got me a tonne of data so I created this script.

### Basics
**feeds_links.csv** is a csv of RSS Feeds. 
The script loads the feeds and regularly checks, retireves new news and saves it to **data/feeds.csv**
