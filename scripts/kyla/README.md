I had a major project for a client recently. Part of that project's output was a bunch of files ftped into a folder somewhere.
This script was made to compliment that project.

When executed this script does the following:
* Checks the src folder for files
* if it doesn't find any it can send an email to alert that it ran
* If it finds files it sends and email to the configured email addresses with those files as attachments.
