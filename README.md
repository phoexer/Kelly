# Kelly

Kelly is the code name for the python code scripts that I write that may or may not mean anything. 

### Why is it called Kelly?
Simple, I give all my major projects a working code name and this year the theme is female names alphabetically. I was at K. Previous names this year included names like
- Abby
- Diana
- Fiona
- Holly

Scripts and mini projects that I do in hours and not days or weeks do not get code names.  Life's unfair like that and Pluto is no longer a planet.
**On a side note, I only got paid for Holly, #sigh**

### What's in this repo

Python code that I write because reasons. Each file included should have a description of it's purpose and if it doesn't then yikes.
I will include a list down below of everything.
